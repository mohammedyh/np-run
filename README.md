# np-run

A CLI tool that lets you browse and execute npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun scripts directly from the command line. No more memorizing commands - just pick, run, and go!

## Todo

- [ ] Check if script can be run in current directory / project
- [ ] Read file and parse `scripts` keys and values in `package.json`
- [ ] Print `scripts` keys and values to stdout as a dropdown
- [ ] Detect the package manager - using lockfile in current directory?
- [ ] When enter is pressed for a chosen script, that script is run.
